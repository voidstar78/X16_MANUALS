This is a proposed "introduction" manual for the X16.  While not the 300+ page full technical reference manual, this is focused as a brief highlight of the "main things to know" for getting started with the Commander X16.

The first part talks about "hardware setup" (of things like the case, kbd/video connections, PSU, and some limitations about SD-cards).

There is also a working example of using the MONITOR followed by a few Appendix examples for using BASIC.
